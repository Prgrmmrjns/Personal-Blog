### Stem cells - Cells with a lot of potential


#### So what are stem cells?
Imagine you grew up went to school and then learn a profession like a teacher, a lawyer or a haircutter. You are in this profession for years and you become an expert in your field. However you are already so old that you cannot start a new life and learn a new profession. And then, suddenly you get a drink that makes you a baby again. You have no expertise in whatsoever but while you were a teacher earlier you now strive to become a pilot. Wouldnt that be cool? While this seems very unlikely in real life scientists in the lab have actually discovered how to return cells of your body into such an early state from which the cells can reorientate into another cell type. Cells in this early state are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Normally, stem cells are pretty ordinary. You currently have billions of stem cells in your body. They function as a backup when cells of your body die and they fill up your tissues with new cells. However, they are either multipotent such as bone marrow stem cells who can produce all kinds of blood cells or they are unipotent meaning that they can only produce one specific cell type. In contrast, pluripotent stem cells are very special as they can differentiate into literally every cell type of your body.

#### What can we do with induced pluripotent stem cells?
iPSCs are currently mainly used for basic research and disease modelling. You can take iPSCs, introduce a genetic mutation seen in a specific disease using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing (another hot topic for another blogpost). In this way the researchers can investigate how this specific mutation may cause the specific phenotype and the complication seens in the disease. For example, you can introduce a mutation often seen in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer´s or Parkinson´s disease into your iPSCs and then differentiate the cells into neurons. These neurons may then undergo experiments to find out physiological or epigenetic properties of the cell. It has been shown that iPSCs with such disease phenotype mutations exhibit abnormal structural and functional patterns from which you may conclude specific mechanisms of the disease. This is very valuable as it is understadibly not a good idea to perform experiments on diseased subjects and tests using iPSCs from patients also have great advantages compared to animal experiments. 
Recently, iPSCs have also been tested in the clinic. For example, it may be possible to create a so called heart patch, a tissue composed of cardiomyocyted derived from iPSCs. This heart patch may be used to accelerate and enhance the regeneration process of the heart after a myocardial infarction. The research with iPSCs has only just begun and offers lots of potential!

#### My work in a stem cell lab
During my Master I worked in a stem cell lab here in Göttingen. I was actively involved in stem cell research and I had to culture and differentiate my own iPSCs and perform experiments with them. iPSCs live in big colonies in petri dishes and you have to give them new medium daily. iPSCs are again just like little babies who are curious and want to grow up - aka differentiate. However, this may not be what you want. In order that these iPSCs stay iPSCs you have to be really careful and care for them well and regularly. In my lab I differentiated cardiomyocytes from these iPSCs. This was the most awesome part as I could see my little babies (that´s what I call my cells) beating after 10 days. However, in a stem cell lab you have to be very patient as often your experiments may not work according to your plan or your cells decide to embark on a different fate. Overall I really enjoyed my lab rotation in the stem cell lab!
